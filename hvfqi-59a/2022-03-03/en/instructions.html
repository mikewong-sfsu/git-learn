<h2>Instructions to Parents</h2>

<p><b>Before starting to answer the questions please read and understand this
section. If you need any clarification please ask.</b></p>

<p>We are looking for specific pattern of visual difficulties using the Higher
Visual Function Question Inventory (HVFQI) to determine how your brain
processes visual images sent by the eye and helps you understand your visual
environment.</p>

<p>The pictures of what you see through your eyes are sent to your brain where
they are made into a mental copy of the scene. This copy is used by the brain
to guide your movements and to find and recognise things. Cerebral visual
impairment (CVI) affects this process. So, it can lead to any combination or
pattern of difficulties with guiding your movements, and finding and
recognizing people, objects and routes. A good term for what this HVFQI does is
to find out about your <i>brain-based visually guided behaviour</i>.</p>

<p>We want to find out what challenges you now have through this HVFQI. Please let
us also know if these challenges are new or longstanding. We also need to find
out if they are getting better, or if you are adapting to them.</p>

<p>In addition, do let us know of any difficulties elicited from these questions
that you feel are not wholly related to your visual perception and may be due
to any other factor.</p>

<p>Your answers help us to understand the range, nature and severity of visual
difficulties caused by CVI, but they do not give us all the information needed
to make a diagnosis of CVI. A diagnosis of CVI is based on putting together
multiple factors determined form a detailed history, eye examination, this
question inventory and other examinations and tests.</p>
