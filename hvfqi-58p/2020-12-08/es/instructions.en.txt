Instructions to Parents
Thank you for your and your child's participation, time and effort.

We want to find out what children at different ages can and cannot see. We want to know about how your child behaves now but not when younger. These questions are designed for a range of ages, so some questions may seem odd. Your child may have difficulty with some behaviours listed below but not others — this is normal. Also you may notice that some of the behaviours described occur occasionally when your child is tired, this is common.

For each of the items listed, please could you tick the box which best fits with your child’s present behaviour:

Never
Rarely
Sometimes
Often
Always
If this question is not applicable to your child, please indicate why:

Not Applicable: The child is too young
Not Applicable: Too old
Not Applicable: Because of the child's physical condition
