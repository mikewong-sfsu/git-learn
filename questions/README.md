# HVFQI Versions

## Introduction: The HVFQI-App

The Higher Visual Function Question Inventory (HVFQI) [1] is a screening tool
for CVI. It has been adapted for cloud-based scalable deployment and global
adoption by a cross-disciplinary team led by Dr. Chadna at the Smith-
Kettlewell Eye Research Institute and by Dr. Kulkarni of the Computer Science
Dept. at San Francisco State University. The web application is called the
HVFQI-App. 

## Versions

There are several versions of the HVFQI to date:

- HVFQI-51: The original paper inventory derived from Dr. Dutton's Insight Inventory
- HVFQI-52: The first (unused) digital version via the HVFQI-App, designed for children aged 0-3
- HVFQI-58p: The first available digital version on the HVFQI-App, designed for children aged 0-3
- HVFQI-59a: The HVFQI adapted for older participants with later onset CVI, aged 4-18
- HVFQI-59ac: The HVFQI adapted for carers of older participants with later onset CVI, aged 4-18

## Localisation

As part of the effort for international access, several versions of the HVFQI
have been translated into different languages. Currently, versions of the
HVFQI are available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Hebrew. Volunteer
opthamologists and eye health care researchers have offered to translate the
HVFQI to Chinese (traditional and simplified), Hindi, and Urdu to make the
HVFQI accessible for their communities. Professional translators are being
recruited for French, German, and to validate the work of the volunteers.
