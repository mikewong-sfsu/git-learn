<h2>Instructions to Parents</h2>

<p>Thank you for your and your child's participation, time and effort.</p>

<p>We want to find out what children at different ages can and cannot see. We
want to know about how your child behaves <b>now</b> but not when younger.
These questions are designed for a range of ages, so some questions may seem
odd.  Your child may have difficulty with some behaviours listed below but not
others &mdash; this is normal. Also you may notice that some of the behaviours
described occur occasionally when your child is tired, this is common.</p>

<p>For each of the items listed, please could you tick the box which best fits with your childâ€™s
<b>present</b> behaviour:</p>

<div class="likert-scale-choices">
	<ul>
		<li>Never</li>
		<li>Rarely</li>
		<li>Sometimes</li>
		<li>Often</li>
		<li>Always</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p>If this question is <i>not applicable</i> to your child, please indicate why:</p>

<div class="not-applicable-choices">
	<ul>
		<li>Not Applicable: The child is too young</li>
		<li>Not Applicable: Too old</li>
		<li>Not Applicable: Because of the child's physical condition</li>
	</ul>
